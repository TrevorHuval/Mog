# MOG
Mog is a student-driven project for a class at LSU.

# Purpose
The intent for the app was to create a social-fitness app that would entice individuals to indulge into the community aspect of fitness.  It contains familiar features as other fitness apps, such as tracking your workouts, as well as a calculator to better inform individuals in their expceted weight calculations.

# Where is Mog now?
Unfortunately, we as a group did not pursue the project any more after the semester ended and we successfully presented our work.
